# Weather App

Created a Weather App to display the weather of the city inputted.

Check the demo here: [Weather App](http://weather.tjgill.com/)

Features of the App:
- Uses the [Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com/) API 
- Uses Asynchronous Javascript async/await and promises
- Uses LocalStorage to save the city inputted by the user, so that when the user refreshes or revisits the page, the same city weather is displayed.
- Uses JS Classes.
